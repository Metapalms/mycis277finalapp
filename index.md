## Complex Message Encoder & Decoder

For an extra credit assignment in my previous C++ class we had made a message decoder. After quickly getting that done I wanted to make a message encoder to go allong with it. There ended up being a slight problem attempting to make the encoder because of how spaces were used in the cipher. Never-theless, now i ant to make my own message encoder and decoder where at the very least I will have ea kick out of using it with my friends.

We have always messed around with talk of using a code to talk to eachother at times so I am figuring why not. With that though if I am going to be doing this I want the encoded message to be fairy hard to crack. Thus I need it to be a fair bit more adaptive than the simple cipher that we had used in the extra credit assignment.

### Possible Ciphers

-monoalphabetic cipher 

-polyalphabetic cipher?

-one time pad encryption?

-enigma machine variant?

Possibly I could have it set so you can do any of the three based on the first number of the cipher code that will be used

### Cipher Code

I am still fleshing out the idea of this. I believe it is going to have to be at least a 3 digit long code. I am not sure yet, however, this code will be something that eiter you and your friend will agree upon before hand or send in the encoded message. Along with that the person who encodes the message will be able to either choose it by hand or use a randomizer that I will put in.
